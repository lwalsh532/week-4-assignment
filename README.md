# Water Fountains in NYC Map Description
 I collected data from NYC Open Data that holds all of the locations of water fountains across NYC. I downloaded the data as a GeoJSON, and uploaded it to my Github for this week's assignment.

 Here is the link to the NYC Open Data for Water Drinking Fountains: https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Environment/NYC-Parks-Drinking-Fountains/622h-mkfu

I used the "create and style clusters" mapbox tutorial we discussed at the beginning of last class.
Attached below is the link to the tutorial.

I prompted users to zoom in to see each drinking fountain. When they click, I displayed which NYC Parks location the fountain is in, if the water fountain is active/inactive, and a precise decrtiption of where the fountain is in the Park.

I then formatted the document to orient the user to NYC, and I changed the color palette of the dots to be blue for a water theme.
